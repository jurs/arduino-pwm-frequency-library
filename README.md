# arduino-pwm-frequency-library
A library with functions to change PWM frequency on Arduino microcontrollers

I can confirm this library works on the Uno and Mega. This library should be compatible with all Arduinos except for Leonardo and Due, however I do not have those models readily available to test.

To see details about this library visit this thread at the Arduino forums: http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,117425.0.html
